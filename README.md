# Jorge Santos - Bia test
Hello. My name is Jorge Santos. This is my test to apply as Front End developer in Bia

## Getting Started

First install the dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can see the implemented page according the designs provided. It's a responsive website.

Search bar redirects to a new page and will show the results. Each country will redirect to the corresponding country page and will show the country information.

Due to time, I wasn't able to finish the Dropdown filter option.
